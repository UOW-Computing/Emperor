# [Emperor](https://github.com/breadsoc/Emperor)

## Instructions

To localy run Emperor, you need a `.env` file.
You can look at `.env.example`, it outlines how the file should look like.

Before creating the file make sure to have a bot ready with its token copied.

You can create one here: [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

Afterwards, either create a `.env` file yourself or use the `setup.py` to create one for yourself.

###### Currently `setup.py` is not ready, will be released in `v0.07` or `v0.08`.
