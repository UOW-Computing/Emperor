### Reporting Issues and Bugs
If you encounter an issue or bug while using Emperor, we encourage you to report it on the [Issue](https://github.com/UOW-Computing/Emperor/issues) tracker.  
When reporting an issue, please include as much information as possible, such as the version of Emperor you are using, Emperor's log file, screenshots of the error, and steps to reproduce the issue.

**In general, Issues  should start with one of the following types:**  
`BUG`: for bug report  
`FIX`: for bug fixes  
`SUGGESTION`: for new features  
`DOCS`: for documentation changes  
`STYLE`: for formatting or style changes  
`REFACTOR`: for code refactoring  
`PERF`: for performance improvements  
`TEST`: for changes to test cases or infrastructure  

**For example, an Issue message might look like this:**

**Another example:**

This command it's meant to be used to generate Issues on the go, an example of this is when encountering bugs through testing.
You can quickly create an issue regarding the bug without having to stop what you are doing.  
After creating the issue you can later come back into the [Issues](https://github.com/UOW-Computing/Emperor/issues) page, and fill in the rest of the report while **following** `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.
